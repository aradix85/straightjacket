# Architecture

How a turn flows through the system. Read this first.

## Turn Pipeline

Player types "I search the room" → engine returns narration + updated game state.

```
player input
  ↓
Scene Test (mechanics/scene.py) → d10 vs chaos factor: expected / altered / interrupt
  ↓
Brain (ai/brain.py)           → single-call classification with injected game state (no tool calling)
  ↓
Roll (mechanics/consequences.py) → 2d6+stat vs 2d10, result: STRONG_HIT / WEAK_HIT / MISS
  ↓
Consequences (game/finalization.py) → move outcome, combat position, clock ticks, crisis check
  ↓
NPC Activation (npc/activation.py) → TF-IDF scores decide which NPCs get full context
  ↓
Prompt Builder (prompt_builders.py) → assembles XML prompt with world, NPCs, result, scene type
  ↓
Narrate (game/finalization.py → narrate_scene)
  → narrator call (ai/narrator.py) → prose with conversation memory
  → parser (parser.py) → strips leaked metadata (10-step cleanup)
  → validator (ai/validator.py) → hybrid rule-based + LLM check, retries with prompt stripping
  ↓
Post-Narration (game/finalization.py → apply_post_narration)
  → engine memories, scene context, AI metadata extraction (ai/metadata.py)
  ↓
Scene-End Bookkeeping         → chaos adjustment, list weight updates, consolidation
  ↓
Director (director.py)        → NPC reflections, AIMS generation, act transitions
  ↓
DB Sync (db/sync.py)          → full GameState → SQLite for query access
  ↓
Save (persistence.py)         → JSON to users/{name}/saves/
```

Dialog turns skip Roll and Consequences. The rest is the same.

## AI Model Assignment

The engine assigns models to AI roles via clusters. Each cluster groups roles that share a model and default parameters. Resolution order: per-role model override → cluster model. `model_for_role(role)` is the single entry point — no module ever hardcodes a model string.

```
Cluster          Roles                                              Needs
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
narrator         narrator                                           prose generation (high temperature)
creative         architect, director                                genre-aware structured output + tool calling
classification   brain, correction                                  input parsing, json_schema
analytical       validator, validator_architect, narrator_metadata,  constraint checking, data extraction
                 opening_setup, revelation_check, chapter_summary,
                 recap
```

Config structure in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
ai:
  clusters:
    narrator:
      model: "zai-glm-4.7"
      temperature: 1.0
      top_p: 0.95
      max_tokens: 8192
      max_retries: 3
      extra_body: {reasoning_effort: "none"}
    creative:
      model: "zai-glm-4.7"
      temperature: 0.8
      ...
    analytical:
      model: "gpt-oss-120b"
      temperature: 0.5
      ...
  # Remap a role to a different cluster:
  role_cluster:
    architect: "analytical"
```

Clusters are the single source of truth. `sampling_params(role)` resolves all call parameters from the role's cluster. `model_for_role(role)` resolves the model. No per-role overrides — to change a role's parameters, change the cluster or remap the role via `role_cluster`.

`max_tool_rounds` is an engine mechanical limit, configured in `engine.yaml` under `pacing.max_tool_rounds`.

Elvira test bot model is configured separately in `tests/elvira/elvira_config.yaml` → `ai.bot_model`.

## Key Design Decisions

**Config-driven game logic.** Move outcomes, NPC limits, disposition shifts, damage tables — all in engine.yaml or Datasworn JSON. Adding a move means adding one YAML entry to `move_outcomes`. No Python change. Move definitions (stats, roll types, trigger conditions) load directly from Datasworn JSON per setting.

**Typed dataclasses everywhere.** GameState has sub-objects (Resources, WorldState, NarrativeState, CampaignState). NpcData has 17 fields. MemoryEntry has 10. Move has 15 fields with typed trigger conditions and roll options. Attribute access, never dict-style. `SerializableMixin` handles serialization; complex classes override `to_dict`/`from_dict` manually.

**Two-call pattern.** Narrator writes pure prose. A second call on the analytical cluster model extracts NPC-related metadata (new NPCs, renames, details, deaths). Same pattern for opening_setup, revelation_check, recap, and chapter_summary. The analytical cluster typically uses a cheaper/faster model for these structured output calls.

**Snapshot/restore.** `GameState.snapshot()` captures all mutable state before a turn. `restore()` reverts everything atomically. Used by correction (##) and momentum burn.

**Provider abstraction.** `AIProvider` protocol with two implementations (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible). The engine never imports provider SDKs directly. `create_with_retry` handles transient errors with exponential backoff. Multi-model: config.yaml assigns models via four clusters — narrator (prose), creative (architect, director), classification (brain, correction), analytical (validator, metadata, recap, and other structured output roles). Clusters are the single source of truth for all call parameters. `model_for_role(role)` resolves the model; `sampling_params(role)` resolves temperature, top_p, max_tokens, max_retries, and extra_body. The provider stores no model state.

**Minimal UI.** Single HTML page, no build step, no npm. Server sends JSON, client renders. Scene headings for screen reader navigation, aria-live for automatic narration readout. One button (Save/Load), one text input. Status via `/status` and `/score` text commands — engine answers directly, no AI call. Status output is narrative, not mechanical: "seriously wounded" instead of "health 2", "growing trust" instead of "bond 4/10". The player never sees numbers, dice, or system terms.

**Progress tracks as dataclass.** ProgressTrack has rank-based ticks_per_mark (troublesome=12, epic=1), status (active/completed/failed). Background vow becomes a track at creation. Track-creating moves defined in engine.yaml `track_creating_moves` — engine creates tracks from Brain output. Connection tracks replace NpcData.bond: `get_npc_bond(game, npc_id)` reads connection track filled_boxes.

**Mythic lists seeded at creation.** Threads list starts with the background vow (weight 2) plus any tensions derived from truth selections via engine.yaml templates. Characters list starts with the vow subject (if provided) and opening scene NPCs. Both lists are in NarrativeState for snapshot/restore.

**Truths as world context.** Player truth selections stored in GameState.truths and injected into every narrator prompt as a `<world_truths>` block. The narrator treats them as established canon. Truths that match engine.yaml patterns automatically seed tension threads.

**AI surface minimization.** Every value derivable from game state is computed by the engine. Director pacing is computed from scene_intensity_history, not requested from the AI. Act transitions fire when scene_count exceeds act range — deterministic, no AI flag. Memory emotional_weight is derived from (move_category, result, disposition) via engine.yaml lookup. Opening scene clock and time_of_day are engine-determined before any AI call. The AI receives results, not choices.

**Data-driven move outcomes.** `resolve_move_outcome` reads structured effect lists from engine.yaml per move per result. Simple moves (momentum, resources, progress, position) are pure data — no Python. Complex moves (suffer, threshold, recovery) use named handlers that share patterns across moves. The `available_moves` function filters moves by game state (combat position, active tracks); Brain receives the filtered list in its prompt. Consequence sentences generated from outcome strings via engine.yaml templates.

**Shared outcome resolution.** Three codepaths produce action narration: normal turns, corrections (input_misread), and momentum burns. All three share `resolve_action_consequences` in `game/finalization.py` — move outcome, combat position, MISS clock ticking, crisis check. Turn.py adds WEAK_HIT clock ticking (intentionally turn-only — correction and burn re-narrate an already-resolved scene). All four narration paths (turn dialog, turn action, correction, burn) share `narrate_scene` — narrator call, parse, optional validation — in one call. Post-narration state mutations share `apply_post_narration` from the same module.

**NPC behavioral stance.** Engine computes per-NPC stance from disposition, bond (via connection track), and move category via engine.yaml stance matrix (60 entries). The narrator receives `stance="evasive" constraint="One fact, then silence."` instead of raw disposition values. The engine tells the narrator how the NPC behaves, not just how they feel.

**Information gating.** Per-NPC gate level (0–4) controls what enters the narrator prompt. Gate 0 = name + description (stranger). Gate 4 = full secrets. Computed from scenes known, gather_information successes, bond level, and stance cap. The narrator cannot reveal what it doesn't have. Stance caps prevent hostile NPCs from being too transparent regardless of bond.

**Database as read model.** SQLite (in-memory, stdlib) mirrors GameState after every turn, creation, correction, restore, and load. GameState dataclasses remain the write model — all mutations go through Python. The database provides indexed queries for prompt builders, tool handlers, and future NPC trigger evaluation. Ephemeral: rebuilt from GameState on load/restore, no migration burden. JSON save files remain the persistence format.

**Tool calling.** Director uses decorator-based registry (`@register("director")`) producing OpenAI function calling schemas from Python type hints. Iterative handler loop: AI calls tool → engine executes → result appended → AI continues, with configurable round limit. Tools are read-only: they query GameState and database but never mutate. Director uses two-phase: tool loop for context, then json_schema for structured output. Brain does not use tool calling — all game state is injected via prompt (moves, NPCs, tracks). Brain's fate_question and oracle_table fields are resolved by the engine after classification.

**Fate system (Mythic GME 2e).** Probabilistic yes/no questions about the fiction. Two methods: fate chart (9×9 odds/chaos matrix, d100) and fate check (2d10 + modifiers). Both produce four outcomes (yes, no, exceptional yes, exceptional no) and can trigger random events via the doublet rule. Likelihood resolver maps game state (NPC disposition, chaos, resources) to odds level via engine.yaml lookup table. Brain sets `fate_question` field; engine resolves after classification.

**Scene structure (Mythic GME 2e).** Every turn starts with a scene test: d10 vs chaos factor. Expected (roll > CF), altered (roll ≤ CF, odd), or interrupt (roll ≤ CF, even). Altered scenes roll on the Scene Adjustment Table. Interrupt scenes generate a random event via the pipeline. Scene test runs before Brain call. Replaces the old chaos interrupt system.

**Random events.** Four-step pipeline: event focus (d100, 12 categories) → target selection from weighted Mythic lists → meaning table roll (actions or descriptions) → structured `RandomEvent` assembly. Events fire on fate doublets and interrupt scenes. `<random_event>` and `<interrupt_scene>` tags injected into narrator prompt. List maintenance: present NPCs/threads get weight bumps, new NPCs added to characters list, consolidation at 25 entries.

**Director reduction.** Director no longer advises on pacing — that is fully engine-computed from scene structure and narrative direction. Director retains NPC reflections (AIMS, arc updates, description updates) and optional chapter summaries. Act transitions are engine-computed from scene count vs act range.

## Known Limitations

**Validator is model-specific.** The hybrid validator (rule-based + LLM) is tuned for GLM-4.7 patterns. Switching narrator model will likely require re-tuning: new agency violation patterns, different atmospheric drift words, different monologue tendencies. The rule validator catches the common cases; the LLM validator catches the rest but is inherently fragile — an unreliable system checking another unreliable system.

**Single session.** One player at a time. The module-level accumulators (`_pending_events`, `_token_log`) and the in-memory SQLite database assume single-threaded access. Multi-session would require per-session state isolation.

**No faction system yet.** NPCs act individually via agenda and goal-clocks. Faction-level schemes, reputation, and NPC loyalty thresholds are on the roadmap (steps 15–16) but not implemented. The "world moves independently" principle is partially realized through autonomous clock ticks and NPC agency checks, not through faction dynamics.

**No asset mechanics.** Assets are stored as ID strings but have no mechanical effect. The modifier pipeline (stat bonuses, rerolls, companion health, vehicle condition) is roadmap step 13.

**Blueprint is AI-generated at game start.** The story architect produces a 3-act or Kishōtenketsu blueprint via a single AI call. Quality varies by model. The engine compensates with mood sanitization and genre validation, but blueprint quality directly affects Director guidance and narrative direction.

## Testing

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v          # ~15 seconds, ~692 tests
python tests/elvira/elvira.py --auto --turns 5   # direct engine (needs API key)
python tests/elvira/elvira.py --ws --auto --turns 5  # via WebSocket server
```

Elvira is the real integration test. Direct mode drives the engine with an AI player bot, checks state invariants after every turn, runs narration quality checks, tests the correction pipeline, and verifies NPC spatial consistency. WebSocket mode does the same but through the full server stack.

## Adding a New AI Provider

1. Create `ai/provider_yourname.py` implementing `AIProvider` protocol (see `provider_base.py`)
2. Add a branch in `ai/api_client.py` → `get_provider()`
3. Set `ai.provider` in config.yaml

## Adding a New Setting

Settings are data packages that combine a Datasworn JSON file (game content: moves, oracles, assets) with a settings YAML file (engine integration: vocabulary, genre constraints, oracle paths).

### Step by step

1. Get the Datasworn JSON for your setting → `data/your_setting.json`. Datasworn JSON files contain the game's mechanical content: moves, oracles, assets (paths/companions/etc). See [github.com/rsek/datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) for the format.
2. Create `data/settings/your_setting.yaml` (use `data/settings/starforged.yaml` as template).
3. The setting appears in character creation automatically — no Python changes needed.

### Settings YAML format

```yaml
# data/settings/your_setting.yaml
id: your_setting                    # Must match the Datasworn JSON filename (without .json)
title: "Your Setting Name"          # Display name in character creation
description: "One paragraph describing the world, tone, and premise."

# Vocabulary substitutions: generic term → setting-specific term.
# Included in every narrator prompt to keep the AI in-genre.
vocabulary:
  spaceship: iron vessel
  planet: forge-world
  alien: abomination

# Genre constraints: what must NOT appear in narration or story blueprints.
genre_constraints:
  forbidden_terms:                  # Words the narrator must never use
    - magic
    - spell
    - wizard
  forbidden_concepts:               # Broader prohibitions for the architect validator
    - "supernatural powers beyond the setting's technology level"
  genre_test: "Could this exist in a world with only pre-industrial technology?"

# Oracle paths: where to find name tables and backstory prompts in the Datasworn JSON.
oracle_paths:
  names:                            # Used by Elvira's character creation for random names
    - "oracles/character/name/given"
    - "oracles/character/name/family"
  backstory:                        # Used for random backstory generation
    - "oracles/character/backstory"

# Character creation flow: controls which UI steps the client presents.
creation_flow:

The `vocabulary` block maps generic fantasy/sci-fi terms to setting-specific language. This implements the design document's vocabulary control principle: the AI writes in the setting's voice instead of defaulting to genre conventions from training data.

The `genre_constraints` block feeds both the rule-based validator (forbidden_terms checked via regex) and the architect validator (forbidden_concepts checked via LLM). The `genre_test` string is a yes/no question the LLM applies to story blueprints.

The `creation_flow` block tells the client which character creation steps to present. Settings without backstory oracles (Classic) skip that step. Settings with ship creation (Sundered Isles) add it. The engine reads these flags in `build_creation_options()` and includes the relevant Datasworn data only when the flag is set.
